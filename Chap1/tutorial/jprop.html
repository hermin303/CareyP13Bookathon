            <h2>Specials This Month</h2>

            <p>The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for the entire month of May:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Basic Stick ($19.95).</strong> The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Flower Stick ($24.95)</strong> A graceful stick with tassels. Flower Sticks float slowly, making them ideal for beginners.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Master Stick ($39.95).</strong> Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Glow Stick ($29.95).</strong> The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick.)
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Quality Tested</h2>

            <p>Every item I create is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my juggling props and I want my customers to feel that same pride.
