Hi guys, 

Welcome to Carey P Bookathon. Here we define "bookathon" in reference to a
marathon we organize to build all the websites that are in the Carey P. (2013) 
book. Because we consider this book as a good one for a beginner in Web development
to start with. 

Here we will publish as much as exercises that are in each chapter of this book. 
The idea is to do all the exercises of the book in order to have the basic skills 
to build a decent professional website.

However, considering the "responsiveness aspect" of websites nowadays. The skills 
taught in This book must be completed by some responsive programming skills from 
jQuery, JS and specially Bootstrap. 

Reference: 
Carey, P. M. (2013). New Perspectives on HTML, CSS, and Dynamic HTML. Place of 
publication not identified: Cengage Learning.

Cordially, 
Hermin R.
